# PerturbGen Foundation model for dynamic cellular states

![PerturbGen overview](docs/fig1.png)
PerturbGen is a trajectory-aware, generative transformer for predicting how genetic or signaling perturbations reshape transcriptional programs across cell state transitions, rather than only within a single fixed state. It formulates time, development, or lineage progression as a sequence-to-sequence (S2S) problem: given an unperturbed source cell state (and optional context from earlier observed/predicted conditions), the model predicts a target downstream state (e.g., a later time point or more differentiated fate), enabling perturbation effects introduced early or mid-trajectory to be propagated to terminal outcomes. Architecturally, PerturbGen uses an encoder–decoder Transformer: a pretrained 12-layer encoder embeds the source gene-token sequence, while a Transformer decoder (dataset-tuned depth) combines self-attention over the target sequence with cross-attention to the encoded source and contextual condition embeddings. Cells are tokenized as ranked gene sequences using a Geneformer-style tokenizer (gene ranks from normalized expression), and decoding is non-autoregressive, following a MaskGIT-style iterative refinement scheme that fills masked tokens in parallel with bidirectional context, which better matches the non-sequential nature of gene regulation than left-to-right generation. Training combines (i) a masked token prediction objective on the target condition conditioned on source + context, and (ii) an auxiliary count reconstruction head (a lightweight MLP with a probabilistic count model) to map learned embeddings back to gene expression space for interpretable transcript-level perturbation readouts. At inference, PerturbGen runs paired forward passes (control vs perturbed) where perturbations are simulated by editing the source gene-token sequence (e.g., KO by removing/zeroing a token; activation by rank promotion), producing predicted downstream expression changes and embedding shifts that can be scaled to genome-wide in silico perturbation atlases across trajectories.

## 1. Usage

First, clone the repo and change to the project directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Lotfollahi-lab/Perturbgen.git
```

Install Poetry (one-time):
(wanna know what is poetry? have a look at https://python-poetry.org)
```shell
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
Optional: alternative way to install poetry using pipx (https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)
```shell
pipx install poetry
```

Create/install the environment and dependencies:
```shell
cd Perturbgen
poetry env use python3.11
poetry install
```

Activate the enviroment
```shell
source "$(poetry env info -p)/bin/activate"
```

The project contains some jupyter notebooks, which were converted to python files
due to better handling in the repository.
These files end with `_nb.py` and can be converted back to a `.ipynb` file with
`jupytext`:

```shell
jupytext --to ipynb --execute <your_file>_nb.py
```
